<li>The observing scripts now check that the dome has reached the correct
position before starting the integration.
<li>The field selection does not select fields closer than 30 degrees to the
moon.
<li>A more automatic standard star observing script.
</ol>
<hr>

<ul>
<li><b>Opening up</b><br>
<ol>
<li>
See the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/tonotes/int/observer/observers_man.html">WFC observing manual</a> for general instructions.
<li>
To improve the dome seeing you should open the south doors (if weather
conditions permit) and the dome (point away from the sun !) about 1-2 hours
before sunset.
<li>
Make sure the IPHAS <a href="iphas_stds.cat">standard star catalogue</a> is
included in the TCS. To include the catalogue give the command
<br><tt>USER&gt;incl iphas_stds</tt>
<li>
You need to provide the coordinate of the moon to the field selection program.
Before starting observing you should get the coordinates from the TCS with the
command
<br><tt>USER&gt;moon</tt>
<br>Put the <b>topocentric</b> coordinates of the moon into the file
<b>/home/intobs/ha_survey/moon.pos</b>.
<li>
You can use the following <a href="iphas.coo">coordinates</a> as input to
<a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/ds/staralt/">staralt</a> to see which IPHAS
regions you can observe when during the night. These coordinates refer to the
first field in each region. A catalogue with field centres generated by Janet
Drew can be found <a href="iphas_centre.coo">here</a>.
<li>
Change to the IPHAS survey directory in the system window
<br><tt>SYS&gt; /home/intobs/ha_survey/</tt>
<li>
<font color=red>Important:</font>Make sure the autoguider is off. If the autoguider is running you will get additional noise !<br>
<font color=red>Important:</font>Make sure the CCD is in <b>FAST</b> readout mode. Never use SLOW mode !!!
<li>
If you want to know the seeing during the night as measured from the survey
images you should start the seeing monitor program before starting flats.
Open a terminal on <b>intdrpc</b> as user <b>intguest</b> (this is the default)
and do
<pre>
DR&gt; cd ~/IPHAS/Seeing
DR&gt; ./get_seeing.perl
</pre>
This will measure the seeing for every target frame and save the data in a file
named seeing_&lt;obsdate&gt;.dat. If you stop the script and restart it then it
will continue at the last file where it stopped. As the measurement takes time
you want to start this early in the night (before the standards ?). Otherwise
the script will take a while to catch up with the current observation.

The information probvided by the script is run number, average seeing in pixels,
average seeing in arcsec, average ellipticity, average sky background,
number of sources used to calculate the average from.
<pre>
r930380.fit  4.05  1.34 0.125    94.1 from  58 sources of G206-034
</pre>
In this example the seeing would be 1.34 arcsec (4.05 pixel), the ellipticity
is 0.125 and the sky background 94.1 counts.
Note that the objects have been extracted from a raw image.

</ol>

<li><b>Evening twilight sky flats</b><br>
<font color=red>Important:</font>Make sure the autoguider is off and the CCD is
in <b>FAST</b> readout mode. Never use SLOW mode !!!<br>
Order of filters: Ha, r, i<br>
Try to get at least 3 flat field exposures (20000-40000 ADU) for each filter.

<li><b>Focusing</b><br>
Use the r filter to focus.
Once the correct focus position is found (the nominal focus is 43.55) then
change the value used by the focus command in the
<b>/home/intobs/ha_survey/filter_wrap.csh</b>
script to the focus value used for the night.

<li><b>Standard star observations</b><br>
These are really only necessary if the night is photometric. But as the
pipeline needs the observation of standard stars to figure out if the observing
was done in cloudy or dusty conditions, they should be taken every night.
<br>
Standard star exposures in the evening are taken in twilight when the sky
is getting dark and the telescope has been focused.
Try to take 2-3 standard stars in each filter distributed in airmass.
<br>
There is a new script that tries to automate the standard star observations.
<br><tt>SYS&gt; /home/intobs/ha_survey/stdobs.csh</tt>
<br>The arguments to the script are the standards that you want to observe.
A list of IPHAS standard stars can be found
<a href="../standards/list.php">here</a>
<br><font color=red>Note:</font>
The exposure time information is kept in the file <b>standard.info</b>.
<br>While observing the standards you might also update the position of the
moon (see above).

<li><b>Survey observations</b><br>
<font color=red>Important:</font>Make sure the autoguider is off and the CCD is
in <b>FAST</b> readout mode. Never use SLOW mode !!!<br>
The fields that should be observed are read from the file fields.todo in the
/home/intobs/ha_survey directory. The already observed fields are listed in
the file fields.done in the same directory.
<ol>
<li>Copy the correct fields.todo.??? file to fields.todo
<li><tt>SYS&gt; /home/intobs/ha_survey/survey_noguide_err.csh</tt>
<li>If you want to change the observed sky region, change the fields.todo
file while the Ha or r exposure is being taken or read out.
<li>To stop the script (after all 3 exposures of a field have been taken),
copy the file empty.dat to fields.todo .
<li>If you stop the script or change region please make sure that you do this
after the offset field has been observed.
</ol>
One standard star should be taken in all filters every 2 hours during the
nights observing.
To get a real time display of the frames as they are coming in, use the command
<b>iphas_rtd</b> in IRAF on the data reduction computer.
<br><font color=red>Note:</font>
If this does not seem to work there are two possible reasons:
(1) you are not in the data directory,
or (2) IRAF was started in the wrong directory.
In the latter case, Exit IRAF (<tt>cl&gt;logout</tt>), change into the home
directory (<tt>csh&gt;cd</tt>) and start IRAF again (<tt>csh&gt;ecl</tt>).

<br><font color=red><font size=+1><b>Important</b></font><br>
If the seeing is good (&lt;1.7 arcsec) and there are no clouds then the priority
for observing regions is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Re-observations of Cat1 fields (Seeing&gt;2.0, ell&gt;0.2, Sky&gt;2000, bad data)
<li>Not yet observed fields
<li>Re-observation of Cat2 fields (Seeing&gt;1.85)
<li>Re-observation of Cat3 fields (Seeing&gt;1.7)
</ol>
Concentrate on getting Cat1 and not observed fields done in all regions before starting on Cat2 and Cat3.
</font><br>
Note:Sky value on raw frames is roughly ADU-1900(Bias level).<br>
The fields.todo files are sorted by priority, with not yet observed fields
having highest priority. To find out what the distribution of to be observed
fields per region in the different categories is, run the "region_status.perl"
script.
<p><tt>SYS&gt; /home/intobs/ha_survey/region_status.perl</tt><p>
Observed region status information is available at the
<a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/ds/IPHAS/status_region.php">regions status</a>
page.

<p>
<font color=red>
Try to observe with the following constraints:
<ul>
<li> Distance from the moon &gt; 30 degrees (must)
<li> Airmass &lt; 1.4 (if possible)
</ul>
</font>

<li><b>Standard star observations</b><br>
Standard star exposures in the morning are taken in twilight when the sky
is starting to get bright and the observing of IPHAS fields has stopped.
Try to take 2-3 standard stars in each filter distributed in airmass.

<li><b>Bias</b><br>
While you wait for morning twilight to come this is a good oportunity to take
some bias frames. Put the Halpha filter in (to prevent light leaking through
the shutter) and take a maximum of 5 bias exposures. If you are in danger of
loosing morning twilight flats then forget about the bias frames - flats are
more important.

<li><b>Morning twilight sky flats</b><br>
Order of filters: i, r, Ha<br>
Try to get at least 3 flat field exposures (20000-40000 ADU) for each filter.

<li><b>Closing down</b><br>
