        <h2>Summary</h2>
      </div>

      <p>This server provides access to the entire collection of pipeline-reduced images that have been obtained as part of the IPHAS survey of the Northern Galactic Plane. The data set consists of 268&thinsp;180 CCD frames, recorded during 67&thinsp;045 exposures across more than 300 nights between 2003 and 2012. The data volume is 1.6 TB.</p>

      <p>All the images were obtained by the
      four-CCD  <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">Wide Field Camera</a> (WFC) at the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/int/">Isaac Newton Telescope</a> (INT) in La Palma. The data were pipeline-processed by the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</a> (CASU). The FITS headers have been updated to include the new, globally re-calibrated <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> photometric zeropoints however.</p>

      <p>This page also provides a table containing the associated meta data
      and the quality control information that is required to select images.
      Note that the raw telescope data and the calibration frames are not available here, they may be found in the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch/query">Isaac Newton Group Archive</a>.</p>

        <h2>Downloading images</h2>
      </div>

      <p>IPHAS images are uniquely identified by the combination of their <i>run number</i>, which identifies the exposure, and their <i>CCD number</i>, which identifies the detector within the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">camera</a> (i.e. CCD number 1, 2, 3 or 4). Run and CCD numbers for a desired region or epoch may be looked up using the metadata table provided below. The run numbers may also be found in the INT's <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/observing/inglogs.php">archive of observing logs</a>.</p>

      <p>When the run and CCD numbers of a desired frame are known, the URL of the image may be composed as follows:</p>

      <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r<b><i>{first 3 digits of RUN}</i></b>/r<b><i>{RUN}</i></b>-<b><i>{CCD}</i></b>.fits.fz</pre>

      <p>For example, the frame recorded by CCD #2 in run number 534002 is located at:</p>

      <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r534/r534002-2.fits.fz</pre> 

      <p>Note that all the images are compressed using the Rice algorithm. Although this format is widely supported by astronomical software, the data can be decompressed using the <a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/">funpack tool</a> if necessary.</p>


     <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <h4>Warning</h4>
        This data set includes <i>all</i> images, including those that were obtained under poor conditions (e.g. clouds, poor seeing, electronic noise). <b>You should verify the quality of the images for your purpose, using the information given below.</b>

      <h2>Metadata table</h2>
    </div>

    <h3 id='metadata-download'>Downloading metadata</h3>

    <p>A table detailing the run numbers, sky coordinates, observing dates, and quality information is available in FITS and ASCII format:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.fits.gz">iphas-images.fits.gz</a> (20 MB FITS);</li>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.txt">iphas-images.txt</a> (41 MB ASCII, limited set of columns).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The table summarises the quality of each image in the <a href="#qcgrade"><i>qcgrade</i></a> column. The value of <i>qcgrade</i> is one of "A", "B", "C", or "D":</p>
    <ul>
    <li>"A"-graded images were found to meet all our quality criteria;</li>
    <li>"B"- and "C"-graded images do not meet the criteria in a strict sense, but may nevertheless be adequate for a range of scientific applications. For example, this category includes images that were obtained under sub-standard seeing (2 to 2.5 arcsec), but are fine otherwise.</li>
    <li>"D"-graded images were excluded from <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> over serious quality concerns and their use is discouraged.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that the quality grades were assigned on a field-by-field basis,
    during which the same-epoch exposures of the field in all three wavebands were evaluated at the same time. Hence, the D-graded category does contain some single-band exposures which are perfectly fine, but were graded poorly because of a quality problem in an accompanying exposure.</p>

    <p>Some fields in the survey footprint were observed more than once, in an attempt to improve data quality. Column <a href="#in_dr2"><i>in_dr2</i></a> in the metadata table flags the best-available image for each field, and marks the images that were used to compile the <a href="/dr2">DR2 source catalogue</a>.</p>

      <h2>Photometric calibration</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Both the image headers and the metadata table provide a photometric zeropoint for each image (keyword PHOTZP). This zeropoint can be used to convert the pixel values (i.e. number counts) into Vega-based magnitudes as follows:</p>

    <pre>mag(Vega) = -2.5*log10(pixel value) + PHOTZP.</pre>

    <p>The PHOTZP value has been computed such that it absorbs the required    
    corrections for atmospheric extinction, gain variations, exposure time, 
    and the DR2 re-calibration shift.                                       
    As these images still include moonlight and other sources of            
    non-astronomical background, they can only support flux measurements    
    that include a suitably-chosen local background subtraction.
