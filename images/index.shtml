      <h1>Accessing IPHAS images</h1>
    </div>

    <p>This server provides access to the entire collection of pipeline-reduced images that have been obtained as part of the IPHAS survey of the Northern Galactic Plane.
    The data set consists of 268&thinsp;180 CCD frames,
    recorded during 67&thinsp;045 exposures across more than 300 nights between 2003 and 2012.
    The data volume is 1.6 TB.<p>

    <p>All the images were obtained by the
    four-CCD  <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">Wide Field Camera</a> (WFC) at the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/int/">Isaac Newton Telescope</a> (INT) in La Palma. The data were pipeline-processed by the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</a> (CASU). The FITS headers have been updated to include the new, globally re-calibrated <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> photometric zeropoints however.</p>

    <p>
    The raw telescope data and the calibration frames are not available from this page. They may be found in the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch/query">Isaac Newton Group Archive</a>.</p>

      <h2>Downloading images</h2>
    </div>

    <p>IPHAS images are uniquely identified by the combination of their <i>run number</i>, which identifies the exposure, and their <i>CCD number</i>, which identifies the detector within the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">camera</a> (i.e. CCD number 1, 2, 3 or 4). Run and CCD numbers for a desired region or epoch may be looked up using the table provided further below on this page. The run numbers may also be found in the INT's <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/observing/inglogs.php">archive of observing logs</a>.</p>

    <p>When the run and CCD numbers of a desired frame are known, the URL of the image may be composed as follows:</p>

    <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r<b><i>{first 3 digits of RUN}</i></b>/r<b><i>{RUN}</i></b>-<b><i>{CCD}</i></b>.fits.fz</b></pre>

    <p>For example, the frame recorded by CCD #2 in run number 534002 is located at:</p>

    <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r534/r534002-2.fits.fz</pre> 

    <p>Note that all the images are compressed using the Rice algorithm. Although this format is widely supported by astronomical software, the data can be decompressed using the <a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/">funpack tool</a> if necessary.</p>


   <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <h4>Warning</h4>
      This data set includes <i>all</i> images, including those that were obtained under poor conditions (e.g. clouds, poor seeing, electronic noise). <b>You should verify the quality of the images for your purpose, using the instructions given below.</b>
   </div>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2>Run numbers and quality information</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A table detailing the run numbers, sky coordinates, observing dates, and quality information is available in FITS and ASCII format:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.fits.gz">iphas-images.fits.gz</a> (20 MB FITS);</li>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.txt">iphas-images.txt</a> (41 MB ASCII, limited set of columns).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The table summarises the quality of each image in the <a href="#qcgrade">qcgrade</a> column as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>"A"-graded images were found to meet all our quality criteria;</li>
    <li>"B"- and "C"-graded images do not meet the criteria in a strict sense, but may nevertheless be adequate for a range of scientific applications. For example, this category includes images that were obtained under sub-standard seeing, i.e. 2 to 2.5 arcsec, but are fine otherwise.</li>
    <li>"D"-graded images were excluded from <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> and their use is discouraged.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many fields in the survey footprint had more than one observing attempt to improve their quality. Column <a href="#in_dr2">in_dr2</a> in the table flags the <i>best-available</i> image for each field.</p>

    <p>Note that the quality grades were assigned on a field-by-field basis, all three bands at once, and hence the D-graded category does contain a small subset of single-band images which are perfectly fine.</p>

    <p>The columns in the table are as follows:</p>
