      <h1>Accessing IPHAS Images</h1>
    </div>

    <p>This webserver provides access to the entire collection of pipeline-processed imaging data that has been produced as part of the IPHAS survey between 2003 and 2012.
    The data set consists of 268&thinsp;180 CCD frames,
    observed during 67&thinsp;045 individual exposures.
    The data volume is 1.6 TB.<p>

    <p>All the images were obtained by the
    4-CCD  <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">Wide Field Camera</a> (WFC) of the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/int/">Isaac Newton Telescope</a> (INT) in La Palma. The data were originally pipeline-processed by the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</a> (CASU), though the FITS headers have been updated as part of <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> to include globally re-calibrated photometric zeropoints.</p>

    <p>
    Note that the raw data and the calibration frames telescope are not available here. They may be downloaded from the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch/query">Isaac Newton Group Archive</a> instead.</p>

      <h2>Downloading images</h2>
    </div>

    <p>IPHAS images are uniquely identified by the combination of their <i>run number</i>, which identifies the exposure, and their <i>CCD number</i>, which identifies the detector in the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">camera</a> (1, 2, 3 or 4). A desired run number may be looked up using the table provided at the bottom of this page, or may also be found in the INT's <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/observing/inglogs.php">archive of observing logs</a>.</p>

    <p>When the run and CCD number of a desired frame is known, the URL of the image may be composed as follows:</p>

    <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r<b>{first 3 digits of RUN}</b>/r<b>{RUN}</b>-<b>{CCD}</b>.fits.fz</b></pre>

    <p>For example, the image observed by CCD #2 in run number 534002 is located at:</p>

    <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r534/r534002-2.fits.fz</pre> 

    <p>Note that all our images are Rice-compressed. Although this compression scheme is supported by most astronomical software, the data can be decompressed using the <a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/">funpack tool</a> if necessary.</p>


   <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <h4>Warning</h4>
      This server provides access to the <i>entire</i> set of the pipeline-reduced images, including any data that was obtained under poor observing conditions (e.g. clouds, poor seeing, electronic noise).
      <b>Do not use this data without verifying the quality (see below).</b>
   </div>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2>Run numbers and quality information</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A table detailing the run numbers, sky coordinates, observing dates, and quality control information is available here:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.fits.gz">iphas-images.fits.gz</a> (20 MB)</li>
      <li><a href="/data/images/iphas-images.txt">iphas-images.txt</a> (41 MB, limited subset of columns).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The quality of an image is summarised by the <a href="#qcgrade">qcgrade</a> column, which can be one of "A++", "A+", "A", "B", "C", or "D". Images graded "D" were generally obtained under very poor conditions and should be avoided, though they may be useful for some science cases.</p>

    <p>The columns in the table are as follows:</p>
