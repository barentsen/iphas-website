    <h1>Accessing IPHAS images</h1>

    <section id="summary">
     <p>This server provides access to the entire collection of pipeline-reduced images that have been obtained as part of the IPHAS survey of the Northern Galactic Plane. The data set consists of 268&thinsp;180 CCD frames obtained between 2003 and 2012. The data volume is 1.6 TB.
      This page also provides the associated metadata
      and documents the use of the images.</p>

      <!--
      <p>All the images were obtained by the
      four-CCD  <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">Wide Field Camera</a> (WFC) at the <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/int/">Isaac Newton Telescope</a> (INT) in La Palma. The data were initially pipeline-processed by the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</a> (CASU), though the FITS headers have since been updated to include the globally re-calibrated photometric zeropoints that were obtained while preparing the
      <a href="/dr2">DR2 source catalogue</a>.</p>
      -->

      <p>
      Note that the raw telescope data and the calibration frames are not available here, they may be found in the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch/query">Isaac Newton Group Archive</a> instead. 
      The raw and processed data are also available through the
      <a href="http://apm3.ast.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wfs/dqc.cgi">CASU dqc interface</a>.

      <p>
        CCD frames may also be downloaded directly from our server.
        Each frame is uniquely identified by the combination of
        its <i>run number</i>, which identifies the exposure,
        and the <i>CCD number</i>, which identifies the detector within the 
        <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/instruments/wfc/">INT/WFC camera</a> 
        used by the survey (i.e. CCD number 1, 2, 3 or 4).
        The run and CCD numbers for a desired position or epoch may be found 
        in the metadata table provided below.
        They may also be found in the "detectionID" columns of the <a href='/dr2'>source catalogue</a>,
        which are in the form "#RUN-#CCD-#SOURCE".
      </p>

      <p>
        When the numbers of a desired frame are known,
        the URL of the image is composed as follows:
      </p>

      <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r<b><i>{first 3 digits of #RUN}</i></b>/r<b><i>{#RUN}</i></b>-<b><i>{#CCD}</i></b>.fits.fz</pre>

      <p>For example, the image for a source with rDetectionID equal to "570144-1-5487",
      i.e. detected in run 570144 by CCD 1, is located at:</p>

      <pre>http://www.iphas.org/data/images/r570/r570144-1.fits.fz</pre> 

      <p>
        Note that the images are compressed using the Rice algorithm. 
       Although this compression scheme is supported by professional software
        such as <i>DS9</i> and <i>Aladin</i>, it is not supported by every FITS viewer yet. 
        If you struggle to open an image, try to decompress it using <a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/">funpack</a> first.
      </p>

    <h3 id='metadata-quality'>Quality grades</h3>

    <p>
      The metadata table explained above provides essential quality information 
      such as the <a href="#seeing"><i>seeing</i></a>,
      <a href="#elliptic"><i>ellipticity</i></a>,
      <a href="#skylevel"><i>skylevel</i></a>,
      and <a href="#skynoise"><i>skynoise</i></a>.
      The quality of each image is summarised in the <a href="#qcgrade"><i>qcgrade</i></a> column, 
      which classifies images as "A", "B", "C", or "D":
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>"A"-graded images were found to meet all our quality criteria;</li>
      <li>"B"- and "C"-graded images do not meet the criteria in a strict sense, 
      but may nevertheless be adequate for a range of scientific applications. 
      For example, this category includes images that were obtained under sub-standard seeing (2 to 2.5 arcsec), but are fine otherwise.</li>
      <li>"D"-graded images were excluded from <a href="/dr2">DR2</a> due to serious quality concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Although the use of D-graded images is generally discouraged,
      we note that the quality grades were assigned on a field-by-field basis.
      That is, each trio of r/i/H-alpha exposures of a field 
      were given a single quality grade based on their combined properties. 
      Hence, the D-graded category does contain some single-band exposures which are perfectly fine, 
      but were graded poorly because of a problem in a partner exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some fields in the survey footprint were observed more than once to improve data quality. 
      The best-available data for each field are flagged by the <a href="#in_dr2"><i>in_dr2</i></a> column, 
      which marks the exposures that were used to compile the <a href="/dr2">DR2 source catalogue</a>. 
      These are also the only exposures for which the photometric zeropoints 
      are calibrated in a global sense to an accuracy of 0.03 mag 
      (see <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4862'>Barentsen et al 2014</a>).

          found in the raw data, because the INT/WFC is known to occasionally
          record incorrect exposure times in the headers.
          This has been corrected, to our best ability, in the images hosted on the IPHAS website.

      <strong>Note:</strong> only the images which were used
      to compile the DR2 source catalogue 
      (i.e. for which column <a href="#in_dr2">in_dr2</a> equals "true" in the metadata) 
      have photometric zeropoints that are globally calibrated to an accuracy of 0.03 mag (rms).

    <p>
      To estimate absolute narrow-band Hα fluxes from the image data,
      we note that the integrated in-band energy flux for Vega in the IPHAS Hα filter 
      is 1.52 x 10^−7 erg cm^−2 s^−1 at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, 
      which is the flux obtained by folding the CALSPEC SED 
      with the filter transmission curve only 
      (the correction for atmosphere and detector quantum efficiency, 
      otherwise scales down the narrow-band flux by 0.707). 
      We note that the Hα magnitude for Vega is set by convention to 0.03 (Fukugita et al. 1996), 
      which implies that the in-band flux corresponding to zero magnitude is:

    <pre>F(Hα=zero) = 1.56 x 10^−7 erg cm^−2 s^−1</pre>

      <strong>Note:</strong> as these images still include moonlight 
      and other sources of non-astronomical background, 
      they can only support flux measurements that include 
      a suitably-chosen local background subtraction.

    <h3 id='astrometry'>Astrometry</h3>

    <p>
      An astrometric solution for the IPHAS images has been determined
      by comparing the positions of our stars against those found in the
      <a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/">Two-Micron All Sky Survey</a>
      (2MASS), which itself is calibrated
      in the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS).
      The root mean square (rms) residual of our astrometric fit against
      2MASS is typically better than 0.1 arcsec, but can occasionally
      exceed 0.5 arcsec near CCD corners.
    </p>

    <p>
      The astrometric solution is recorded in the FITS headers
      by means of a series of World Coordinate System (WCS) keywords.
      IPHAS uses the Zenithal PolyNomial (ZPN) projection,
      which is required to model the radial distortions in the focal plane
      (see <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...395.1077C'>Calabretta &amp; Greisen, 2002</a>).
      As part of DR2 we have reprocessed the WCS keywords
      to ensure that they are in line with the current standard.
    </p>

      An example WCS extracted from an IPHAS image is given below.
      Note that each image contains its own solution.
