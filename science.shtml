      <h3>IPHAS point-source selections</h3>

      <p>219 million have been detected at a typical seeing of
      1.1 arcsec and cataloged in DR2.  The important object classes
      that IPHAS data readily distinguish include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>compact planetary and symbiotic nebulae; rapidly evolving post-AGB stars</li>
        <li>Be stars of all types (including young Herbig stars, and B[e] supergiants)</li>
        <li>lower mass young stellar objects and dMe stars</li>
        <li>a range of interacting binary stars (symbiotics, `supersoft' compact binaries, WD/NS/BH accreting binaries generally)</li>
        <li>H-rich white dwarfs</li>
        <li>large numbers of near-main-sequence A stars and M giants</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This figure is a schematic representation of the (r-H&alpha;, r-i) colour-colour plane that IPHAS data define. The points plotted are
          the IPHAS colours of already-known objects falling into the object classes specified in the key. The main stellar locus, occupied by the great majority
          of normal stars, is located in between the synthetic tracks drawn in black, corresponding to unreddened (left) and reddened (E(B-V) = 4, right) main
          sequences.  The dotted tracks crossing this area are the unreddened and E(B-V)=4
          giant-star sequences.</p>
      <p>The figure is from <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0712.2391">Corradi et al 2008</a>. A discussion of the properties
        of the colour-colour plane, IPHAS survey methodology and
        sample data, was presented in <a href="http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2005MNRAS.362..753D">Drew
        et al 2005</a>. (See also
        the <a href="publications.shtml">publications page</a>).</p>

      <h3>IPHAS and extinction mapping</h3>

      <p>A feature of the IPHAS colour-colour plane that has great
      utility is the nearly orthogonal dependencies of increasing
      reddening and intrinsic stellar colour.  For stars located 
      within the main stellar locus, this bestows a one-to-one
      correspondence between (r'-H&alpha;,r'-i') co-ordinates and 
      (intrinsic colour, interstellar reddening).  In turn this 
      implies that the main stellar locus can be analysed very effectively for
      constraints on the rise in interstellar extinction with distance
      into the Galactic disk.  A recent demonstration of this is provided
      by the comprehensive mapping of the northern Galactic Plane by
      <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.443.2907S">Sale
      et al (2014)</a>.  Data from this study may be accessed via our 
      <a href="data.shtml">data pages</a>.</p>


      <h3>IPHAS and transient objects</h3>

      <p>IPHAS has proved to be a valuable resource for identifying
        nova progenitor objects.  Nova Vul 2007, or V458 Vul
        (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...688L..21W">Wesson
        et al 2008</a>) was a particularly striking example. Most
        unusually, the progenitor object of V458 Vul was seen in IPHAS
        data to have an association with what appears to be a
        planetary nebula.  Other examples have been reported via
        "Astronomers Telegrams" (see e.g. <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=795">ATEL
        No. 795.</a>
        and <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1031">ATEL
        No. 1031.</a>).  There are more examples on the <a
        href="publications.shtml">publications page</a>.</p>
