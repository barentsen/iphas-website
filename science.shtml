      <h3>IPHAS point sources</h3>

      <p>More than 100 million have been detected at a typical seeing of
      1.1 arcsec:</p>

      <p>The important object classes that IPHAS data readily
      distinguishes are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>compact planetary and symbiotic nebulae; rapidly evolving post-AGB stars</li>
        <li>Be stars of all types (including young Herbig stars, and B[e] supergiants)</li>
        <li>dMe stars; clusters of lower mass young stellar objects</li>
        <li>a range of interacting binary stars (symbiotics, `supersoft' compact binaries, WD/NS/BH accreting binaries generally)</li>
        <li>H-rich white dwarfs</li>
        <li>large numbers of near-main-sequence A stars and M giants</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This figure is a schematic representation of the (r'-H&alpha;, r'-i') colour-colour plane that IPHAS data define. The points plotted on it are
          the IPHAS colours of already-known objects falling into the object classes specified in the key. The main stellar locus, occupied by the great majority
          of normal stars, is located in between the synthetic tracks drawn in black, corresponding to unreddened (left) and reddened (E(B-V) = 4, right) main
          sequences. For main sequence stars in this region, there is a one-to-one correspondence between (r'-H&alpha;,r'-i') co-ordinates and (intrinsic colour,
          interstellar reddening): this provides the jump-off point for extinction mapping. The dotted tracks crossing this area are the unreddened and E(B-V)=4
          giant-star sequences.</p>
      <p>The figure is from <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0712.2391">Corradi et al 2008</a>. A discussion of the properties
        of the colour-colour plane, IPHAS survey methodology and sample data, have been presented by <a href="http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2005MNRAS.362..753D">Drew
        et al 2005</a>. (See also the <a href="publications.shtml">publications page</a>).</p>


      <h3>IPHAS and novae</h3>

      <p>IPHAS has proved to be a valuable resource for identifying nova progenitor objects. The most striking success in this regard has been Nova
        Vul 2007, or V458 Vul (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...688L..21W">Wesson et al 2008</a>). Most
        unusually, the progenitor object of V458 Vul has an association with what appears to be a planetary nebula. Previously the progenitor object was found
        for V2362 Cygnus (nova outburst on 2 April 2006, IAUC No. 8697, and see <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=795">ATEL
        No. 795.</a> for a report on the progenitor properties). The consortium also identified the progenitor of V2467 Cyg, which went into outburst on 15
        March 2007 (see <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=1031">ATEL No. 1031.</a>).</p>
